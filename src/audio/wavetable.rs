/// A structure which holds a wavetable oscillator.
///
/// A wavetable oscillator is used to store the shape of a wave in a table or an array which can
/// later be played at a specific frequency. There are several advantages to storing a wave this
/// way, most notably:
///
/// - Efficiency: It is more efficient to use a lookup table to store certain shapes of waves such
///   as sine waves than to call the sin() function.
/// - Timbre: It is easy to change the shape of the wave to something more complex such as a square,
///   sawtooth or triangle wave.
///
/// This implementation of a wavetable oscillator also allows you to play multiple frequencies of
/// the wave at the same time.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use music_tools::audio::player::AudioPlayer;
/// use music_tools::audio::common::Waveforms;
/// use music_tools::audio::wavetable::WavetableOscillator;
/// use music_tools::common::Beat;
/// use music_tools::note::Note;
///
/// let mut square_oscillator = WavetableOscillator::new(Waveforms::SQUARE_WAVE, 1.0, 128);
/// let mut player = AudioPlayer::try_new().unwrap();
/// player.set_synth(square_oscillator);
/// player.push(&Note::from_string("A4").unwrap(), &Beat::WHOLE);
/// player.play();
/// ```

    /// - `wave_function`: The function used to generate the shape of the wave that will be played
    ///   by the new wavetable. It must receive a parameter of type [`f32`] representing the time
    ///   value of the wave between 0 and `max_time`, and it must return an [`f32`] representing the
    ///   height of the wave at that time between -1 and 1.
    /// - `max_time`: This parameter scales the time variable that is passed to `wave_function`.
    /// - `wavetable_size`: The amount of points to store in the wavetable. The higher this value,
    /// the higher the quality of the signal at the cost of a higher memory consumption. A value of
    /// 128 is recommended.
